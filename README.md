Hello, world!
=============

The main **programming** aim of this project is to create basic 'hello world' programs in multiple different languages. I understand that isn't exactly a difficult proposal, nor a particularly interesting one, but the true objective is to familiarise myself with Git (and later, GitHub), Dvorak, and Vim. Most likely this will not be of much use to anyone else.
